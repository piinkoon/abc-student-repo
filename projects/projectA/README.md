"SAME OLD, SAME OLD" is a project that is meant for the user to linger on and explore each element. I wanted to take the idea of the "quarantine routine" that most people established for themselves during the height of the pandemic, and create a visual story to evoke feelings of familiarity as the user experiences the story. There are some characters (like the cat), but I wanted it to be ambiguous and allow the user to insert themselves in if they wanted to.

Overall, the main compromise I had to make was due to time (particularly lack of it). I wanted to have the project change over time, like every 1-2 hours, that would align with the user's timezone no matter where they are in the world. For example, if I viewed it at 8am, I would see a morning scene, but if I returned at 8pm I would see a nighttime scene. I could have done this, but with the time I had free to work on it, I felt as if I would not have been able to capture the idea with the level of detail I wanted it to have. So, I decided to make a fewer amount of pages that still carry my idea forward, but made it more feasible to complete and have as much detail as I wanted.

Some other challenges had to do with the scaling of the background image with the rest of the elements, as I could only rely on my one computer screen to make everything but had no way to see what it would look like on other displays (larger ones or smaller ones). This was also mentioned during feedback, so if I keep working on this project on this future I have to keep that in mind. Other than that, I am satisfied with the end product! I attempted to make projects with this collage aesthetic (one of my favorite visuals to work with) in projects in the past, but I think this one turned on the best :)
