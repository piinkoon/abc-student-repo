    <div class="content">
      <h2>How does it work?</h2>
      <p>It's quite simple, really!</p>
      <p>First, you have this picture:</p>

      <img id="scene1" src="../scene1.JPEG" alt="scene1">

      <p>In this picture, there are multiple events and characters composing a scene.</p>
      <p>Whether you are by yourself or online with a group of other collaborators, you are able to take the role of the author, create the scenario for what these characters are doing, and write out their story!</p>

      <h2>How do you start?</h2>
      <p>The text edit box is set to "read only", meaning that it cannot be typed into. To start writing, simply insert your name in the indicated area and hit the "Start Writing" button. This announces that you have started your turn, and allows you to type in the box and start writing.</p>

      <h2>How do you stop?</h2>
      <p>When you're done writing as much as you want, hit the "Stop Writing" button. This announces that you finished your turn, sets the edit box back to being "read only", and allows another user to add on to the story.</p>
      <p id="bold">The goal is to have fun, be imaginative, and take turns while writing when there are multiple collaborators online!</p>

      <h2>Saving</h2>
      <p>When you think you are done writing the story, hit the "Save" icon in the top left corner. This saves the story to a database.</p>
