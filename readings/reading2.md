Overall, these two readings were very fun to read and definitely took me down a nostalgic sort of memory lane (which actually directly fits into the focus of my capstone-- how media perpetuates nostalgia through visual aesthetics/ trends! How nice!). I really enjoyed reading each of Lialina's explanations of these visual components of the "old web", and found it nice that each of them had their own section. It was also nice to hear her own thoughts and opinions about these components as well, particularly moments of reflections on past web experiences or aspects that she missed, as it made these informational pieces more personal and therefore allowed for the reader to agree with her (or not).

Something I also found quite interesting was the difference in layout between the two pages as it visually connects with a running theme of the fast-paced evolution of the internet (to Web 2.0 as she calls it in 2007). While this is very cool to see, something that ends up being a bit of a disappointment is how most of the links provided as sources in both of these works don't work anymore, which also refers back to that evolution and how the "old web" that is missed becomes no longer accessible. All in all, it seems like more "modern" connections back to those early stages of the web (the one I grew up with as a kid) are gifs(the sparkly ones definitely triggered some memories), low quality meme images, and the aesthetic of basic HTML and CSS, etc. In my opinion, I think the first two (gifs and memes) are probably/ arguably one of the most stable connections to the past web that we still have today.
