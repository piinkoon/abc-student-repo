For me, this idea of context and content is quite interesting to think about. I think, based off of the way I understand this part of the reading, is that prior to a commercial shift of the net, content and context worked together and had a sensical relationship to each other as concepts. However, it seems that the relationship was split as the net started to go down a sort of commercial route (as mentioned previously). It's as if the context gets lost as the content is utilized to earn a maximum profit, which further makes it easier to understand how and why net art and the artists that make it would go against that trend.
