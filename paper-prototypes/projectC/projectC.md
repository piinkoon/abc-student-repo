My main idea for this project is to have an interactive space where multiple people can come together and write a story together. I plan to draw up images that work together like a story, and allow the visitors to work on fleshing out the scene and writing a story together.

I had a hard time coming up with an idea, but I found myself reflecting on my Project A and how much I enjoyed making it. I really liked the idea of storytelling in that project, so I thought that making it collaborative would be really fun and interesting. I also wanted the visuals to carry that collage look I really like (throughout IMA classes I took that has kind of become a theme I carry throughout somehow), and make the scenes as "crazy" full as possible to allow people to notice and potentially write about different things.

I think the mechanics are similar to the chat room demo that we had worked on previously (using Express and Socket.io), to allow the multiple users to input their text into the story.

For other goals (if I have time), I would like to potentially add a way for the entire story to be visible at the end. What I mean by this is, after the writers finish writing bits for all of the scenes, they would be able to see all of the images and all of what they wrote at the end. I also think it would be cool to have multiple sets of scenes that could allow for the writers to pick and choose what kind of story they want to write, based off of what image sets they prefer.
