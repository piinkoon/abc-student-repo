My main idea for this project is to have some interaction between the cursor and the elements of a page. In this case, the interaction would be the elements being propelled away from the cursor, leaving the user unable to click or really do anything because the cursor will never "touch" anything.

For example, I thought a really good example of this project would be on a Google search page. Usually you use the search engine to find answers to a question you have, or to find something in general. However in this case, instead of simply being able to click a link and find the answer to your question, the cursor would just push the link away. In the end, it's like the cursor ends up chasing all the elements around the screen, and the user can't get the answer to their question. (I tried to illustrate this to the best of my ability down below;;)

I suppose the theme this idea deals with is "the unknown". In this case, the user is so close to getting an answer or finding the source they need, but because they can never access it with the extension on, it remains unknown.

Overall, this "parasite" of an extension doesn't aim to create a fun or exciting experience. Rather, it aims to create a particularly frustrating and annoying experience, like a never-ending chase.
