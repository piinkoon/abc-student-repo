      <h1>Week 1 Reading Response</h1>
      <p>Something that this article immediately made me think of was a class I took at the NYC campus a few semesters ago, in which we discussed Lacan’s “Mirror stage” theory one week. Lacan’s theory basically discusses the argument that the “ego” or “ideal self”/ “persona” is created when a young child sees its reflection in the mirror for the first time. It obviously goes a lot deeper than that, but I couldn’t help but think about it when reading this article. Furthermore, it is undeniable that the rise of the computer/internet age not only introduced gaming as a popular hobby/ pastime, but also greatly enhanced communication between the masses via networks and platforms. With that in mind, as well as Lacan’s original theory, it makes me wonder if being behind the screen is like a “Mirror stage 2.0” where the pre-established conception of the self can be manipulated and changed in the form of an avatar or an online persona, in which that digital avatar/ persona becomes the new “ideal”. This not only leads to the interesting stories of catfishing online (the story in this article definitely had me thinking of moments on “Catfish: The TV Show” by the way), but also how virtual escapism becomes more prominent as the “self” can become so easily altered. Aspects such as gender and race (that the article mentions) as well as own character and personality can be changed instantly, whether expressed in a chat forum or fake social media profile, or literally through visuals as someone creates their own representative avatar in a video game. (Albeit kind of freaky) this concept is very much so intriguing!
